# Real-Time Crypto Dashboard

The **Real-Time Crypto Dashboard** is a dynamic cryptocurrency analysis tool that combines real-time data visualization, predictive analytics, and market trend analysis. It integrates advanced machine learning models like LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) to forecast cryptocurrency prices, providing users with a powerful interface for exploring and understanding market behavior.

## Features

- **Candlestick Chart**: Visualizes historical price trends with open, high, low, and close prices, accompanied by trading volume.
- **Prediction Chart**: Forecasts future prices using LSTM models, offering insights into market trends.
- **Technical Indicators**:
  - **Exponential Moving Average (EMA)**: Calculated over 20 days for trend analysis.
  - **Simple Moving Average (SMA)**: Computed over 20 days for price movement insights.
  - **Additional Features**: Includes key metrics like high, low, open, close prices, and volume for comprehensive analysis.
- **Year-over-Year (YoY) Change**: Highlights the percentage change in price compared to the same time last year, offering a long-term perspective on market trends.
- **Month-over-Month (MoM) Change**: Tracks the percentage change in price compared to the same time last month, providing insights into recent price movements.
- **Note**: Timezone is in UTC.

## Technical Details

### LSTM Predictions
- LSTM is a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) designed for sequence prediction.
- It processes historical data (e.g., past 48 hours of prices) and predicts the next price.
- Predictions are displayed alongside actual prices in the **Prediction Chart**.

### Key Features in LSTM Model:
- Input sequences of historical data (e.g., 192 timesteps for 15-minute intervals).
- Target values are the next closing price.
- RMSE quantifies the accuracy of predictions.

## Model Evaluation


The following table shows the **Root Mean Square Error (RMSE)** values for each cryptocurrency. RMSE is used to evaluate the accuracy of the LSTM predictions, with lower values indicating better performance.

| Product ID      | RMSE        |
|-----------------|-------------|
| ADA-USD         | 0.0115      |
| ADA-USD         | 0.0125      |
| DOT-USD         | 0.1124      |
| ETH-USD         | 37.8910     |
| BAT-USD         | 0.0022      |
| BTC-USD         | 11302.3387  |
| DOGE-USD        | 0.0793      |
| BTRST-USD       | 0.0255      |
| ATOM-USD        | 0.0845      |
| LINK-USD        | 1.1694      |
| RAD-USD         | 0.0187      |
| MANA-USD        | 0.0080      |
| SUSHI-USD       | 0.0185      |
| SOL-USD         | 10.7063     |
| MATIC-USD       | 0.0039      |
| REQ-USD         | 0.0010      |
| ICP-USD         | 0.1028      |
| XRP-USD         | 0.5542      |

### **Insights:**
- **Low RMSE**: Cryptocurrencies like `REQ-USD` (0.0010), `BAT-USD` (0.0022), and `MANA-USD` (0.0080) demonstrate highly accurate predictions.
- **High RMSE**: `BTC-USD` shows a significantly high RMSE (11302.3387), likely due to its large price scale.
- **Moderate RMSE**: Most altcoins, such as `DOT-USD`, `ATOM-USD`, and `XRP-USD`, show moderate prediction accuracy, with RMSE values between 0.1 and 1.0.

This evaluation highlights the effectiveness of the LSTM model in capturing price trends for most cryptocurrencies while identifying areas for further optimization.

## Dashboard
### **1. Prediction Chart**

The Prediction chart displays **predicted values** for the next six data points, generated using the LSTM model:
- **Markers** indicate the predicted prices at each step.
- A **star marker** highlights the predicted price and time for the final data point (after six minutes).

This setup provides both historical context and forward-looking predictions for informed decision-making.

### **2. Candlestick Chart**
